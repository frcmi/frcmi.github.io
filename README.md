# Mercer Island FRC Robotics Team 5937 Documentation
The hope of this initiative is to preserve information and provide independent reading material. The Markdown and HTML/CSS builds to [a static site](https://frcmi.github.io) for just reading. 

## Contributing 
1. Navigate to [content/](https://github.com/frcmi/frcmi.github.io/tree/master/content) folder.
2. Add folder with name under subgroup folder.
3. Write markdown content in _index.md file in folder (README.md can be added to folder to be seen in GitHub, but will only be seen in GitHub).
