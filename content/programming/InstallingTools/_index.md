## [WPI Lib VSCode](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html)
Follow the instructions in the link to install a modified version of VS Code including all the FRC WPI Lib libraries needed to build code.
Other IDEs may be useable but are not officially supported for Java in FRC.

## [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
As of writing this, the version of VS Code the WPI installer bundles is too outdated to log in to GitHub. 
Other desktop applications like GitHub desktop may be useable for basic actions, but we really recommend the functionality offered by GitKraken.

You might get a warning about a free trial/tier for GitKraken, do not worry the free tier should include all the features needed for us.

## Not explicitly a tool but gives you free stuff [Github Education Starter Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
You can use a picture of your ASB card to get access to a whole bunch of free things like GitHub pro, the whole suite of Jetbrains products, and hundreds of dollars of server credits.
