# Battery Trouble? You're at the right place.
Over the last year 5937 has learned of many useful resources about the Lead-Acid batteries we use in FRC, which we just want to quickly put here. This page will be expanded upon later.

## Surface Charge
[When charging fast like 6A you can seem to have just a bit more current than you really do.](https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/44197/what-is-surface-charge-and-how-does-it-affect-battery-testing)

## PowerBeak
The PowerBeak is a very useful product that measures multiple qualities of a battery. [The manual found here can be very useful and on page 11 talks about surface charge as well.](https://andymark-weblinc.netdna-ssl.com/media/W1siZiIsIjIwMjEvMDYvMjMvMTAvMDEvMzcvOGJhMDIzNmEtOTMzNy00Njk4LTlkNzQtNzdkMzMxMmMyN2QwL0JlYWstVXNlci1NYW51YWwucGRmIl1d/Beak-User-Manual.pdf?sha=c8b9fb48878145ef)

## We're not the only team to try to publish our battery research
Especially until this page is finished, there is a lot of insight to be found at [Team 1640's wiki which talks about use of a Computerized Battery Analyzer that we are awaiting delivery of now after reading about.](https://team1640.com/wiki/index.php/Battery_Management#Battery_Testing)
